# Fizz Buzz Go!

Fizz Buzz is a game where each player takes it in turns to count to a number.

However each time a player must say a multiple of 3, they say Fizz instead and each time they say a multiple of 5, they must say Buzz instead.

This example allows the user to customize the maximum value the program counts to and define their own keywords and multiples.

Additionally, the computer plays with itself.
